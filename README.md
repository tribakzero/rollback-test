# rollback-test

This repo is made to simulate a real repo, to understand how to revert back ~~master~~ main without push privileges

CHANGELOG:

- Initial repo state, with a basic README and this line.
- I'm making extra changes directly to **main** branch to simulate lots of PRs already in.
- Let's keep going, I'm already enjoying this hahaha.
- Oh boy, that backfired quickly. Luckily I'm able to rewrite history.
- Didn't worked with a regular merge...
